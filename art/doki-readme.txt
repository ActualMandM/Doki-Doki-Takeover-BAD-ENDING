Thank you for downloading Friday Night Funkin’: Doki Doki Takeover! Here’s a few
things you should know before you begin.

MILD EPILEPSY WARNING for the original Monika Week.

MILD HORROR WARNING. This mod will get a little spooky. Note that the more
disturbing topics present in Doki Doki Literature Club are not present within
this mod.

This mod is best experienced if you have played through / watched the original
Doki Doki Literature Club. Story-wise, this mod takes place directly after Act 3.

Also note that this mod is based on a visual novel, which means that there will be
A LOT OF DIALOGUE AND TEXT, so get ready to READ, DAMMIT!

Sincerely,
The DDTO Mod Team
